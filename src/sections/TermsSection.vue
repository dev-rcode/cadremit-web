                        You can add funds to your Balance using an authorized payment account. By initiating a transfer, you authorize Cadremit to access and

                        It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the recipient's information. Once you have confirmed a transfer, it is considered final and cannot be reversed by you. Cadremit equips you with tools 
                        to review and verify your order before confirming it, thereby assisting in identifying any potential mistyped orders. However, any losses arising

                        withdrawal purposes. It is your responsibility to ensure absolute certainty regarding your intention to make a transfer, as Cadremit does not 
                        provide refunds or the ability to reconvert funds from CAD back to Naira. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that the currency 
                        conversion is final and cannot be reversed for withdrawal purposes.
